Hosted code for a reddit post about Cloud9's 2019 Summer Split

Cloud9 ended the split with a **66.7%** win rate before the tie-breaker against CLG, and a **68.4%** win rate after it. Here are graphs of Cloud9's [win rate by patch](https://imgur.com/u3ZLKNX), as well as a [running win rate by week](https://imgur.com/nuzYcYy).  Keep in mind here that not every patch had the same number of games played on it, but it looks like Cloud9's best patches were 9.10 and 9.14.

Now for some in-game stats. Cloud9 got first blood in **63.2%** of their games, winning **58.3%** of those games. Surprisingly, they did even better when their opponents got first blood, winning **85.7%** of those games. When Cloud9 got first blood, they also got **16.7%** of first dragons, **33.3%** of first towers, and were the first team to get the three outer towers **58.3%** of the time.

In general, Cloud9 got **42.1%** of first [dragons](https://imgur.com/3ANcfVq) and first turrets (**75%** win rate), **63.2%** of rift heralds (**66.7%** win rate), **68.4%** of first barons (**92.3%** win rate), and were the first team to break the three outer turrets **52.6%** of the time (**90%** win rate).

In terms of individual performance, Nisqy was the [kill leader](https://imgur.com/Fl33wIn), having played as a carry in every regular season game and not sharing time with another player. Unsurprisingly, Zeyzal was ahead of the [vision game](https://imgur.com/QcGgRuh), having twice as many wards + ward kills as anyone else on the team.

Now the most important stat: who is the biggest KDA player on Cloud9? The answer is Deftly with a 6.0 KDA! He was followed closely by Zeyzal, Nisqy, and Sneaky.
