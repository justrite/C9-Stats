# [C9-Stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cloud9/comments/cmvrpr/some_stats_from_cloud9s_2019_summer_split/)
Hi everyone, I've been playing around in Python and I decided to show you what I found using the team's Summer Split data. Quick disclaimer, this is meant to be for fun, and I feel an obligation to give as little fuel as possible to the "reddit analyst" meme and say that stats don't always speak for themselves, they need to be interpreted in context. I also want to remark that I chose some of these stats to look at under the assumption that the majority of games are going to follow the flow of first blood -> dragon/shelly -> towers -> baron. With that being said, let's get started!

Cloud9 ended the split with a **66.7%** win rate before the tie-breaker against CLG, and a **68.4%** win rate after it. Here are graphs of Cloud9's [win rate by patch](https://imgur.com/u3ZLKNX), as well as a [running win rate by week](https://imgur.com/nuzYcYy).  Keep in mind here that not every patch had the same number of games played on it, but it looks like Cloud9's best patches were 9.10 and 9.14.

Now for some in-game stats. Cloud9 got first blood in **63.2%** of their games, winning **58.3%** of those games. Surprisingly, they did even better when their opponents got first blood, winning **85.7%** of those games. When Cloud9 got first blood, they also got **16.7%** of first dragons, **33.3%** of first towers, and were the first team to get the three outer towers **58.3%** of the time.

In general, Cloud9 got **42.1%** of first [dragons](https://imgur.com/3ANcfVq) and first turrets (**75%** win rate), **63.2%** of rift heralds (**66.7%** win rate), **68.4%** of first barons (**92.3%** win rate), and were the first team to break the three outer turrets **52.6%** of the time (**90%** win rate).

In terms of individual performance, Nisqy was the [kill leader](https://imgur.com/Fl33wIn), having played as a carry in every regular season game and not sharing time with another player. Unsurprisingly, Zeyzal was ahead of the [vision game](https://imgur.com/QcGgRuh), having twice as many wards + ward kills as anyone else on the team.

Now the most important stat: who is the biggest KDA player on Cloud9? The answer is >!Deftly with a 6.0 KDA! He was followed closely by Zeyzal, Nisqy, and Sneaky.!<

I hope you guys found this interesting. Here are some links.
